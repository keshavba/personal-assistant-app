# Python Personal Assistant App

Hello! This project involved creating a personal assistant app that works with voice commands and has features such as performing Google and Youtube searches, finding a location on Google Maps, and creating and deleting events on Google Calendar. This was my first experience working with Python, and I used the Speech Recognition library to process the voice commands. For the Google searches, I implemented a Google programmable search engine to obtain the top 10 results for a search query using the Custom Search JSON API. For the calendar functionality, I used the Google Calendar API to allow the user to modify their calendar by setting up calendar events and deleting events. This project was a great experience as I learned a lot about APIs and Python.
